# LoxSharp
### Current Chapter 5 Representing Code
The C# implementation of the Lox Tutorials written by @munificentbob found at http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/
[Crafting Interpreters](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters)
### Notes
* Instead of using an external script to generate the expressions this project uses [T4s](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb126445.aspx) and are in the main project.
* A few functions have been renamed to match C# syntax standards but should be pretty easy to follow.
